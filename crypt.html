                    <h2> Chapter 1: AES </h2> 
                    <p>
                        <b>Objective</b> The objective of Lab 3 is to introduce students to AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption and its relevance in the context of ransomware attacks. By the end of this lab, students will understand how AES encryption works, its role in protecting data, and how it relates to decrypting data encrypted by ransomware.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Ransomware Attack:</b> A ransomware attack is a type of cyberattack where malicious actors encrypt files or systems and demand payment (a "ransom") from the victim in exchange for decryption keys. Ransomware attacks can have severe consequences, including financial losses, data breaches, and operational disruptions.</p>
                    <p><b>Delivery Methods:</b> Ransomware is typically delivered through various methods, including phishing emails, exploit kits, malicious websites, and remote desktop protocol (RDP) vulnerabilities. Once executed, ransomware encrypts files on the victim's system, making them inaccessible until a ransom is paid.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p><b>Scenario:</b>
                        You are a cybersecurity analyst tasked with investigating a ransomware attack on a fictional organization's network. The ransomware has encrypted sensitive files, rendering them inaccessible. Your mission is to decrypt these files and restore them to their original state.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Gameplay:</b>
                        Download AES Folder: To begin, download the AES folder containing encrypted files affected by the ransomware attack.
                    </p>
                    <p>Decrypt the Files: Use your knowledge of AES encryption to decrypt the files within the AES folder. You'll need to find the decryption key or passphrase to unlock the encryption and recover the data.</p>
                    <p>Hints and Clues: Throughout the game, you'll find hints and clues scattered across the lab environment. These hints will guide you in identifying the encryption key or passphrase required for decryption.</p>
                    <p>Decrypt Successfully: Successfully decrypt all the files affected by the ransomware attack to complete the game. You'll gain valuable insights into AES encryption and its role in cybersecurity.</p>

                    <p><b>Learning Outcomes:</b>
                        Understand the basics of AES encryption and its importance in securing data.
                    </p>
                    <p>Apply encryption techniques to decrypt files affected by ransomware and mitigate its effects.</p>
